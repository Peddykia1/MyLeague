# **My league**

## *what?* *who?* *why?*

- My application will be able to create basketball teams and the players within them, make them compete and record their
  stats and use those stats to create methods to rank each team/player.
- Any one can use it as long as it is used for basketball, can even create your own teams, they dont need to be real
  teams.
- I like basketball and math.

 ## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to create a new player and add it to a team
- As a user, I want to be able to select a team and find the team captain
- As a user, I want to be able to select a team and view all starting players
- As a user, I want to be able to select a team and view all substitution players

## *Instructions for Grader*

- You can add a team by pressing the button that says "Add Team", which prompts the user to enter the name of the team 
  followed by the name of the 15 players in the team.
- You can generate the first required event related to adding Xs to a Y by clicking the button that says "View Starters",
  which will prompt the user to select a team, followed by displaying the next 5 players if you have added at least one
  team or displaying "Invalid Input" if the team doesn't exist.
- You can generate the second required event related to adding Xs to a Y by clicking the button that says "View Substitutes",
  which will prompt the user to select a team, followed by displaying the next 10 players if you have added at least one
  team or displaying "Invalid Input" if the team doesn't exist.
- You can locate my visual component by running the main method in the gui class in the ui package.

## *Phase 4: Task 3*
- If there was more time I would mainly adjust the Gui class so that instead of one long constructor there were specfic 
methods that adjusted the behaviour of the frame. I would also have the class extend Jframe instead and create an 
interface for logprinter and have the Gui class implement it.
